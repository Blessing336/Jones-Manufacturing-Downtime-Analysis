# Project Background
Jones Soda, a specialty beverage manufacturer known for its flavored sodas, initiated a production analysis project aimed at **reducing operational inefficiencies caused by recurring production line downtime**. The project was commissioned in response to rising internal costs, inconsistent batch performance, and delayed order fulfillment attributed to both machine malfunctions and operator errors.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze, visualize, and interpret production line data with a specific focus on **identifying root causes of downtime, quantifying their impact on operational performance, and providing actionable insights that will help Jones Soda reduce downtime by at least 50%**.

### Key Analysis & Recommendation Areas
* Machine-Side Downtime Diagnosis:
Identifies and quantifies downtime due to machine-related issues (e.g., failures, jams, inventory shortages). 

* Operator Performance Review:
Evaluates operator-specific errors, including machine misadjustments and inefficiencies during batch changes. Tracks downtime minutes and costs attributable to each operator, and pinpoints common error types.

* Operator-Machine Specialization Profiling:
Attempts to determine which operators perform best on which product machines by comparing error type frequency to number of batches handledâ€”guiding smarter workforce assignments.

* Product-Level Vulnerability Assessment:
Maps downtime causes across different soda products (e.g., Cola, Lemon Lime, Orange).<br><br><br>
